================

Idea: Promote gov APIs by making them dead simple and suggesting clever recipes (like IFTTT and Zapier).

**Contribute!** Add your random ideas below. Here is the [list of government APIs and developer hubs](http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources).

rough brainstorming

* if census releases economic indicator above/below something
* government status changes (opm.gov/status)
* USAJobs, FOIA, Federal Register keywords come up
* CPSC recalls - Jed Sundwall
* New entries on regulations.gov - @alandelevie
* TSA security line wait times reach a certain time
* I would say 'farmers market opens for the year' but think that the metadata for that API isn't parsed out well enough for that.  - @gbinal
* I wonder if it'd be possible to use the NREL API to power something that would alert you whenever there's a new alternative fuel station that opens within a certain geographic area... - @gbinal
* Maybe airport status (not quite the same as line times)?  E.G.  Triggers that are based off of an airport getting shut down.  I feel like many frequent flyers would be interested in getting a heads up of an event like this morning's at LAX for any airport in the lower 48, not just certain ones.  - @gbinal
* A we the people petition passes x number of signatures, includes x keywords
* "I had always envisioned agencies pushing each of their posts from any platform into an open Google Calendar so they can better see the spread of coverage between their sub-agencies, etc, and there would also be an easy to evaluate record for the public." - Justin Herman
* Do a "cook-off"/hackathon w/ fed devs and IFTTT folks - @erie
* If Natural Disaster (per NOAA) then Resources (localized per GPS) (FEMA) + (CDC) + (HHS) + (Coast Guard) + (National Guard) @hobokenmartha

logistics/questions
--

* Start by turning triggers into RSS feeds and promoting IFTTT recipes with them? Popular (albeit pointless) example: Text me when CDC reports a Zombie outbreak https://ifttt.com/recipes/48155
* GSA is working with IFTTT now... updates appreciated...
* Research YQL and Yahoo Pipes
*

* I'll be working on this at [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org).
* Go research [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/recipes) and Zapier for cool gov recipes that already exist.
* Edit this readme file with suggestions/ideas.
